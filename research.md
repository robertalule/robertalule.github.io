## 🧬 Research Workflows & Technical Notes

I document selected computational and bioinformatics workflows that I actively use and maintain. These notes are written as reproducible, educational references and reflect my hands-on analysis work.

* **RNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline (Linux-based):**  
  From raw FASTQ files to gene-level count matrices, including quality control, trimming, splice-aware alignment, and read quantification.  
  → [View RNA-Seq Pipeline]( /rnaseq-pipeline/ )

* **Differential Expression Analysis with DESeq2 (R/Bioconductor):**  
  Statistical modeling and interpretation of RNA-Seq count data.  
  → *(Coming soon)*
