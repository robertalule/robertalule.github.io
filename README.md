# Hello, I am Alule Robert.

[cite_start]I am a **Researcher and Educator of Biological Sciences** based in **Mukono, Uganda**[cite: 3, 4].

[cite_start]Currently, I am pursuing an **MSc in Biochemistry** at **Makerere University** (Department of Biochemistry and Systems Biology), focusing on **Host-Pathogen Interactions** and **Dynamical Modelling**[cite: 22, 23, 13, 14].

### My Mission
[cite_start]I am a results-driven researcher dedicated to creating and improving products for medicine and conservation biology. [cite_start]I combine wet-lab techniques with advanced statistical tools to analyze microbial and pathological data[cite: 9].

### Core Interests
* [cite_start]**Infectious Diseases:** Understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms of disease[cite: 15, 16].
* [cite_start]**Systems Biology:** Applying dynamical modelling to biological systems[cite: 14].
* [cite_start]**Immunometabolism:** Investigating cellular adaptation to stress[cite: 17].
